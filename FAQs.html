              <h5 style="color: #243553;">APR Disclosure.</h5>
              <p>
                Some states have laws limiting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
                that a lender can charge you. APRs for cash advance loans range
                from 200% to 1386%, APRs for installment loans range from 6.63% to
                485%, and APRs for personal loans range from 4.99% to 450% and
                vary by lender. Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or
                loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even
                higher APR. The APR is the rate at which your loan accrues
                interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan,
                repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally
                required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before
                you execute a loan agreement. APR rates are subject to change.

                service to qualified participating lenders that may be able to
                provide amounts between $100 and $1,000 for cash advance loans, up
                to $5,000 for installment loans, and up to $35,000 for personal
                loans. Not all lenders can provide these amounts and there is no

                solicitation for loan products which are prohibited by any state
                law. This is not a solicitation for a particular loan and is not
                an offer to lend. We do not endorse or charge you for any service
                or product. Any compensation received is paid by participating

                questions or concerns regarding your loan please contact your
                lender directly. Only your lender can provide you with information
                about your specific loan terms, their current rates and charges,
                renewal, payments and the implications for non-payment or skipped
                payments. The registration information submitted by you on this

                a loan from a participating lender. Cash transfer times and
                repayment terms vary between lenders. Repayment terms may be
                regulated by state and local laws. Some faxing may be required. Be
                sure to review our FAQs for additional information on issues such
                as credit and late payment implications. These disclosures are

              <p>
                Residents of some states may not be eligible for some or all
                short-term, small-dollar loans. Residents of Arkansas, New York,
                New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia are not eligible to use

              <h5 style="color: #243553;">Credit Implications.</h5>
              <p>
                The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.
                Independent, participating lenders that you might be connected
                with may perform credit checks with credit reporting bureaus or
                obtain consumer reports, typically through alternative providers
                to determine credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit
                capacity. By submitting your information, you agree to allow
                participating lenders to verify your information and check your
                credit. Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in
                our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid
                within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a
                solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow
                an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period.
                Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial
                needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans. Late Payments
                of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities,
                or both. Each lender has their own terms and conditions, please
                review their policies for further information. Nonpayment of
                credit could result in collection activities. Every lender has its
                own renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. Please
                review your lender’s renewal policy.
