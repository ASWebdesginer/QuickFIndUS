                Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable
                terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
                arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
                Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally
                fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions
                of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the
                arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope,
                enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
                Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
                streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
                arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                individual basis that a court can award to an individual under
                these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are
                enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for
                very limited reasons.</span

              Unless FlexLoans.com and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
              hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for
              both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and
              other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree
              on a location, the determination will be made by AAA or the
              arbitrator. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, FlexLoans.com
              agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
              conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
              arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
              hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
              $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
              Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
              conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision
              sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
              which the award is based.

              If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of
              this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above
              titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
              Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the
              parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
              provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
              expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
              provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as
              so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
              provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class
              and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are
              invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration

              to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for
              public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will
              continue to apply.

              <h5>APR Disclosure.</h5>
              <p>
                Some states have laws limiting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
                that a lender can charge you. APRs for cash advance loans range
                from 200% to 1386%, APRs for installment loans range from 6.63% to
                485%, and APRs for personal loans range from 4.99% to 450% and
                vary by lender. Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or
                loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even
                higher APR. The APR is the rate at which your loan accrues
                interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan,
                repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally
                required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before
                you execute a loan agreement. APR rates are subject to change.
              </p>

                The operator of this website is not a lender, loan broker or agent
                for any lender or loan broker. We are an advertising referral
                service to qualified participating lenders that may be able to
                provide amounts between $100 and $1,000 for cash advance loans, up
                to $5,000 for installment loans, and up to $35,000 for personal
                loans. Not all lenders can provide these amounts and there is no
                guarantee that you will be accepted by an independent,
                participating lender. This service does not constitute an offer or
                solicitation for loan products which are prohibited by any state
                law. This is not a solicitation for a particular loan and is not
                an offer to lend. We do not endorse or charge you for any service
                or product. Any compensation received is paid by participating
                lenders and only for advertising services provided. This service

                to the full terms of your loan, including APR. For details,
                questions or concerns regarding your loan please contact your
                lender directly. Only your lender can provide you with information
                about your specific loan terms, their current rates and charges,
                renewal, payments and the implications for non-payment or skipped
                payments. The registration information submitted by you on this

                repayment terms vary between lenders. Repayment terms may be
                regulated by state and local laws. Some faxing may be required. Be
                sure to review our FAQs for additional information on issues such
                as credit and late payment implications. These disclosures are

              <p>
                The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.
                Independent, participating lenders that you might be connected
                with may perform credit checks with credit reporting bureaus or
                obtain consumer reports, typically through alternative providers
                to determine credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit

                participating lenders to verify your information and check your
                credit. Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in
                our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid
                within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a
                solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow
                an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period.
                Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial
                needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans. Late Payments
                of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities,
                or both. Each lender has their own terms and conditions, please
                review their policies for further information. Nonpayment of
                credit could result in collection activities. Every lender has its
                own renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. Please
                review your lender’s renewal policy.
