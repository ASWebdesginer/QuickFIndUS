            <h5>APR Disclosure.</h5>
            <p>
              Some states have laws limiting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
              that a lender can charge you. APRs for cash advance loans range
              from 200% to 1386%, APRs for installment loans range from 6.63% to
              485%, and APRs for personal loans range from 4.99% to 450% and
              vary by lender. Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or
              loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even
              higher APR. The APR is the rate at which your loan accrues
              interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan,
              repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally
              required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before
              you execute a loan agreement. APR rates are subject to change.

            <p>
              The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.
              Independent, participating lenders that you might be connected
              with may perform credit checks with credit reporting bureaus or
              obtain consumer reports, typically through alternative providers
              to determine credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit
              capacity. By submitting your information, you agree to allow
              participating lenders to verify your information and check your
              credit. Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in
              our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid
              within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a
              solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow
              an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period.
              Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial
              needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans. Late Payments
              of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities,
              or both. Each lender has their own terms and conditions, please
              review their policies for further information. Nonpayment of
              credit could result in collection activities. Every lender has its
              own renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. Please
              review your lender’s renewal policy.
