                    <p class="styleNameparagraph">A cookie is a small piece of data sent from the Sites and stored in a user’s web browser while the user is browsing Sites (“Cookie”). Every time the user loads Sites, the browser sends the Cookie back to the server to notify the Sites of the user’s previous activity. Web beacons (also known as image tags, gifs, or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses (“Web Beacons”). We also utilize pixels in connection with our email communications and in connection with the Sites. Our Sites’ web servers automatically collect and may use your Cookies, Web Beacons, pixels, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively “Tracking Technologies”) to collect information as you browse our Sites. We use Tracking Technologies, web server log files and tracking code, and information we receive through the use of these Tracking Technologies to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Information of this type may be combined with other sources of information for these purposes.</p>
                    <p class="styleNameparagraph">Some of these Tracking Technologies may be placed by third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Tracking Technologies may be used by these service providers to place a persistent Cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. The use of Tracking Technologies by third-party service providers is within their control and not ours. We do not control their sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use, or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet. This Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party service provider may directly collect from you and we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or police their practices</p>
                    <p class="styleNameparagraph">You have the right to choose whether or not to accept Cookies. However, they are an important part of how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove Cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services. You may reject Cookies, Web Beacons, and entity tags by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject Cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or to allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by the following browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile; and Android browser.</p>

              <h5>APR Disclosure.</h5>
              <p>
                Some states have laws limiting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
                that a lender can charge you. APRs for cash advance loans range
                from 200% to 1386%, APRs for installment loans range from 6.63% to
                485%, and APRs for personal loans range from 4.99% to 450% and
                vary by lender. Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or
                loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even
                higher APR. The APR is the rate at which your loan accrues
                interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan,
                repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally
                required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before
                you execute a loan agreement. APR rates are subject to change.

                provide amounts between $100 and $1,000 for cash advance loans, up
                to $5,000 for installment loans, and up to $35,000 for personal
                loans. Not all lenders can provide these amounts and there is no

                solicitation for loan products which are prohibited by any state
                law. This is not a solicitation for a particular loan and is not
                an offer to lend. We do not endorse or charge you for any service
                or product. Any compensation received is paid by participating

                questions or concerns regarding your loan please contact your
                lender directly. Only your lender can provide you with information
                about your specific loan terms, their current rates and charges,
                renewal, payments and the implications for non-payment or skipped
                payments. The registration information submitted by you on this

                repayment terms vary between lenders. Repayment terms may be
                regulated by state and local laws. Some faxing may be required. Be
                sure to review our FAQs for additional information on issues such
                as credit and late payment implications. These disclosures are

              <h5>Exclusions.</h5>
              <p>
                Residents of some states may not be eligible for some or all
                short-term, small-dollar loans. Residents of Arkansas, New York,
                New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia are not eligible to use
                this website or service. The states serviced by this website may
                change from time to time, without notice.
              </p>
              <h5>Credit Implications.</h5>
              <p>
                The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.
                Independent, participating lenders that you might be connected
                with may perform credit checks with credit reporting bureaus or
                obtain consumer reports, typically through alternative providers
                to determine credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit
                capacity. By submitting your information, you agree to allow
                participating lenders to verify your information and check your
                credit. Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in
                our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid
                within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a
                solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow
                an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period.
                Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial
                needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans. Late Payments
                of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities,
                or both. Each lender has their own terms and conditions, please
                review their policies for further information. Nonpayment of
                credit could result in collection activities. Every lender has its
                own renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. Please
                review your lender’s renewal policy.
