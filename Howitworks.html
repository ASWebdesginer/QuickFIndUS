            <h5>APR Disclosure.</h5>
            <p>
              Some states have laws limiting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
              that a lender can charge you. APRs for cash advance loans range
              from 200% to 1386%, APRs for installment loans range from 6.63% to
              485%, and APRs for personal loans range from 4.99% to 450% and
              vary by lender. Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or
              loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even
              higher APR. The APR is the rate at which your loan accrues
              interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan,
              repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally
              required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before
              you execute a loan agreement. APR rates are subject to change.
            </p>
            <h5>Material Disclosure.</h5>
            <p>
              The operator of this website is not a lender, loan broker or agent
              for any lender or loan broker. We are an advertising referral
              service to qualified participating lenders that may be able to
              provide amounts between $100 and $1,000 for cash advance loans, up
              to $5,000 for installment loans, and up to $35,000 for personal
              loans. Not all lenders can provide these amounts and there is no
              guarantee that you will be accepted by an independent,
              participating lender. This service does not constitute an offer or
              solicitation for loan products which are prohibited by any state
              law. This is not a solicitation for a particular loan and is not
              an offer to lend. We do not endorse or charge you for any service
              or product. Any compensation received is paid by participating
              lenders and only for advertising services provided. This service
              and offer are void where prohibited. We do not control and are not
              responsible for the actions of any lender. We do not have access
              to the full terms of your loan, including APR. For details,
              questions or concerns regarding your loan please contact your
              lender directly. Only your lender can provide you with information
              about your specific loan terms, their current rates and charges,
              renewal, payments and the implications for non-payment or skipped
              payments. The registration information submitted by you on this
              website will be shared with one or more participating lenders. You
              are under no obligation to use our service to initiate contact
              with a lender, register for credit or any loan product, or accept
              a loan from a participating lender. Cash transfer times and
              repayment terms vary between lenders. Repayment terms may be
              regulated by state and local laws. Some faxing may be required. Be
              sure to review our FAQs for additional information on issues such
              as credit and late payment implications. These disclosures are
              provided to you for information purposes only and should not be

            <h5>Exclusions.</h5>
            <p>
              Residents of some states may not be eligible for some or all
              short-term, small-dollar loans. Residents of Arkansas, New York,
              New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia are not eligible to use
              this website or service. The states serviced by this website may
              change from time to time, without notice.
            </p>
            <h5>Credit Implications.</h5>
            <p>
              The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.
              Independent, participating lenders that you might be connected
              with may perform credit checks with credit reporting bureaus or
              obtain consumer reports, typically through alternative providers
              to determine credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit
              capacity. By submitting your information, you agree to allow
              participating lenders to verify your information and check your
              credit. Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in
              our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid
              within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a
              solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow
              an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period.
              Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial
              needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans. Late Payments
              of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities,
              or both. Each lender has their own terms and conditions, please
              review their policies for further information. Nonpayment of
              credit could result in collection activities. Every lender has its
              own renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. Please
              review your lender’s renewal policy.
